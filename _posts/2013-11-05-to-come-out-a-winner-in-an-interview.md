While the first step to landing the job you covet is the application and covering note, the most important hurdle is the interview. To succeed you need to be a step ahead of the interviewer. To do this you must prepare and that to well.

First and foremost you must prepare well. Write a resume that you can back up with facts during the interview. Well before the meeting; prepare yourself by combing through your resume and jotting down successes and failures. Be sure to pen stories that you can relate, just stating facts weakens your position if you can highlight how you succeeded in x, y, or z against most odds that will highlight your skills.

Always dress appropriately for an interview. Most HR persons will check whether a person is well groomed and has clean finger nails and footwear. Wear a clean well pressed suit that is comfortable. Interviews use grooming as one criterion to judge whether a person will fit the company culture.

&#8221; Prepare thoroughly. Research as much as possible on the company get not just performance information but personal feed back as well. Know about profit, future plans, company structure and culture, as well as HR policies.

&#8221; Prepare answer difficult as well as easy questions. If you practice answering difficult questions then you will not falter at the interview. Focus on strengths, skills, achievements, and what you can bring to the company.

&#8221; Surf the World Wide Web and find out what are the most likely questions in an interview. See how well you can answer the commonly asked questions.

&#8221; Request the interviewer for a business card and send a polite thank you note on reaching home.

&#8221; On the day of the interview try and prepare for the ordeal ahead by listening to music, doing stretching exercises or yoga, or meditation and breathing. Keep all you need including your clothes ready the day before. Plan how you will travel and if you are driving where you will park the car.
