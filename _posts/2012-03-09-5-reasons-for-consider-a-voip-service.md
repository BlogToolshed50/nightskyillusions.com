VOIP is the acronym for Voice over Internet Protocol and its function, simply stated, is the use of Internet for both outbound and incoming phone calls instead of the regular or analog phone line. Some VoIP services are limited to you calling only those using the same service, but most other providers allow you to call anyone who has a telephone number &#8211; be it local, long distance, mobile, or international number.

The bandwidth that has become increasingly available in recent times has prompted many businesses to abandon the traditional telephone provider and prefer one that transmits their voice communication over their existing network infrastructure. Those already paying for the high-speed Internet connection will find it both easy and cost-effective making the switch to VoIP. Further VoIP provides facilities such as voice-mail, call waiting, transferring between extensions etc.

You have to live with times and when a customer calls at your office, you can ill-afford to look unprofessional. VoIP system will reflect the professional image your business deserves. There are a lot of reasons why customers are choosing VoIP in their offices as well as homes. From amongst the many reasons, one can identify five compelling ones.

\# It is a common knowledge that Internet is becoming increasingly hi-tech through broadband connections, thus making VoIP more reliable and with better voice quality. Users will no longer complain about dropped calls, inaudible calls and other similar malfunction. Most VoIP phone systems have an easy upgrade process where you can expand the capacity and the number of users with a couple of clicks of the mouse. This advantage enables you to pay only for capacity you need.

\# It is to be noted that VOIP enables Unified Messaging, integrating email, voice mail, IM, and Outlook integration. VOIP provider packages invariably allow unlimited outward and inward calls including international calls. For people who frequently make overseas calls, VOIP can mean terrible cost savings.

\# Some VOIP services are computer based and lets one speak using a microphone connected to a computer. Thus a computer based VOIP system is also capable of transmitting video enabling the user to see the person while talking. VOIP systems that do not use a computer have a digital VOIP phone or a VOIP adapter for use in tandem with a regular telephone.

\# VoIP is portable in the sense your phones will behave identically whether it is in your office, home, or anywhere else where there is a high-speed Internet connection. With traditional phone service, the number is tied to a single physical location and moving to another location means getting a new number. However, with VoIP the user merely plugs in the phone wherever he is and the same number is still applicable.

\# Needless to say, using VoIP is much cheaper &#8211; for one reason, there is a lot of competition among VoIP carriers each trying to beat the other down with price. Further, VoIP utilizes the existing Internet connection, which means there is no necessity to pay for access and usage fees on two separate sets of wires. It is even reported that most VoIP service providers offer a fixed fee for use on a monthly basis and this fee is a lot lower than a regular phone service.
