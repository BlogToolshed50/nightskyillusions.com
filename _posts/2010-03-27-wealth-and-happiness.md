Recently, I read an article which seems to be more relevant from the economy point of view and the philosophy of human life. &#8220;More Money Makes Society miserable, the caution comes from an economist Jamie Doward&#8217;. Two renowned professors of economics Curtis Eaton and Mukesh Eswaran through their complicated study too found out the outcome to be the same. It is rather astonishing to digest the outcome of their study that the increase in the wealth of a country is leading to the decreasing happiness.

Various studies on the relationship between the wealth of the person and the nation has revealed an interesting conclusion that the prosperity and wealth could only bring invalid happiness. The valid happiness that was associated with the instinct of the human being carried over in the physiology. Unless wealth is assisting the person to add new happiness to the existing happiness that was carried over from the experience of our forefathers, it is of no use.

When the wealth of the individual is increasing he becomes addict to various habits like drugs, smoking, sex abuse, etc, which gives him the invalid happiness. It is high time that every one of us uses our wisdom to add new happiness, which is valid in nature to the one already existing in our system. Otherwise, we need not take credit for the wealth creation.
