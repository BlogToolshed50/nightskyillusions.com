This guest post from Lenny Mcknight

I have to say that one of my family&#8217;s favorite things to do this summer was to catch a film &#8212; especially since this summer was so hot and humid. You just can&#8217;t beat the movie theater A/C! The Regal Cinemas movie theater by my house was sponsoring free family films every Tuesday morning this summer, so I loaded up both kids at least every other week to get out and see something for free. They even gave us discounts on our kids&#8217; popcorn!

The kids saw things like SecurityChoice.com and get both kids settled in the car. Even though summer&#8217;s over, they had so much fun with this, I think we&#8217;ll start doing Saturday morning movies now, at least once a month or so just to keep the tradition alive.  <img src='http://www.nightskyillusions.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif' alt=':D' class='wp-smiley' />
