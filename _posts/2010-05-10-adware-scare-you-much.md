Ad-ware is on of those things that most internet users don&#8217;t even think about until its too late. More often than not the majority of us do not even realize the existence of spy-ware until the damage has been done. Each and every day thousands of hidden applications are trying to gain access to computers all over the internet.

The amazing thing is that only a small percentage of people protect themselves from this kind of ad-ware parasite and most only seek protection once the damage has been done. There are many ways that spy-ware and ad-ware can take advantage of those of us who tend to be lacking in the area of computer security. Most times it is just our internet usage details that these nastiest are after but at the other end of the scale there are some adware programs that are acting in a completely sinister manner.

If we all treated our computers like our bank accounts then you would not even be reading this article. The sad fact is we do not and every day there are thousands of people that are putting their private details at risk. None of us should have anything in our computers that we do not want and did not willingly invite but I would bet my last paycheque that anyone reading this article has a few unwanted extras lurking in the depths of their P.C&#8217;s.

It is absolutely essential that you be very aware of the possibilities with the latest of today&#8217;s scum-ware. If you are not willing to purchase some internet protection on the grounds that you might be infected then you should at least take advantage of an online scan. These scans are free and easily accessed so to be honest it would be sheer madness to ignore their existence and simply carry on regardless.

Run a free ad-ware scan and the end result will be you are either spy-ware free or do in fact have a computer stowaway nestling inside your computer. If you are ad-ware free then you can carry on without a care in the world, Your money will still be in your pocket and your computer will be running safely. If on the other hand you do find an intrusion then you can simply spend a little of your cash and rid the gremlin from your computer.

There are many free ad-ware help sites all over the internet and it is very easy to get the latest news on all the recent ad-ware outbreaks. Listen to the experts and weigh up what you have to lose.

If your computer is clean then a free scan will cost you nothing. If it is infected then just how much do you stand to lose should your data be accessed?
