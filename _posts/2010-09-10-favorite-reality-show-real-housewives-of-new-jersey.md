Who has not seen the &#8220;Real Housewives of New Jersey‚Äù on satellite television. This show is truly hit amongst a diverse audience of people! I remember being so surprised when all of my guy friends told me they watched &#8220;Real Housewives of New Jersey&#8221; in their spare time. The women on this show just have an appeal that can not be denied.

I love watching Caroline manage her family on the program. I think it is fascinating to see how this woman with three grown children deals with their recurring problems and keeping the family together in an age of technology. Caroline is an amazing woman with much love for her family. In the one episode, her son is almost expelled from law school for his poor grades during the first semester. Unfortunately, the son had a learning disability which prevented him from succeeding as well as his classmates. He needed a 2.0 to continue taking classes at the school, but he only managed to get a 1.9. I loved seeing how Caroline talked with her son and motivated him to press on toward his goals no matter what anyone says or does during his lifetime. This is such an important message for young people to hear!

I love Real Housewives of New Jersey because these housewives are some of the most &#8220;real&#8221; on television. They love their families and would do anything for them!
