My youngest sister moved to Romania to get married about six months ago. She met her husband while he was studying at a university in the United States on a visa. After he was done with school his visa expired and they spent almost a year apart. They decided she needed to go to Romania and marry him so he could come back and live with her in the United States near us. She didn&#8217;t know how beautiful Romania was going to be and now she doesn&#8217;t want to leave.

The family and I are planning to go visit her and her new husband. The only way we can communicate with her is via our satellite internet New York and that&#8217;s the same lifeline we used to book our flights. It&#8217;s very expensive but we&#8217;re hoping she&#8217;ll miss us enough to want to come back to the United States. We are also hoping that it isn&#8217;t so beautiful over there like she says and none of us come back.

Thanks to hughes net internet, in just four weeks the nine of us will be on board a plane to a totally different country. The visas are in order, the luggage is ready to be packed, and I&#8217;m a little scared about being out of the country for the first time. It&#8217;s surely is a great story to tell.
