Every spring I watch the TV Land Awards Show. The reason I love this show is because TV Land brings back casts of TV shows from yester-year as well as the upcoming new shows. It&#8217;s always exciting to see the actors and actresses I used to love when I was a kid reunited again.

It&#8217;s also fun to see the musical and comic skits that they put together each year. The best part is that you never know what&#8217;s going to happen from year to year. It&#8217;s also brings back a lot of memories for me from when I was younger. I remember how watching those shows when I was little used to make me feel happy and safe. Mostly we used to watch sitcoms every night at dinner time. I always knew that when I certain TV show came on, my Dad would be home very soon and dinner would be on the table waiting for him. It&#8217;s funny when you get older how just seeing a certain show can bring those memories back again.

If it&#8217;s one show that I never miss, that would have to be the TV Land Awards. That&#8217;s why I make sure to turn on my tv service from direc4u and get ready for that special night year after year. I can&#8217;t wait to see my favorite awards show this year again!
