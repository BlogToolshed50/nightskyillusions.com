Guest post of the week by Nestor Nielsen

The ped egg is my favorite infomercial because the product works just the way it is shown on the show. I purchased the Ped Egg and used it to remove a callous from my foot and built up dead skin on both of my feet that the nail shop just could not do and to my surprise after using it twice my feet were as soft as baby&#8217;s skin.

One of the great features of the product is that the encasing for the Ped Egg catches all the dead skin and leaves absolutely no mess on the floor for you to clean up all you have to do it open it and dump it directly in the trash and its ready to use for the next time. Depending on how much dead skin you need to remove you may have to empty it a few times which I did. The product is small and very light weight so you can put it in your purse if you&#8217;re traveling and it is very inexpensive. It&#8217;s nice that it&#8217;s inexpensive because I love ExpertSatellite.com. The funny thing is that I saw the Ped Egg commericial on the new direct tv service I got from them.
