Although reading is thought of as the quintessential solitary activity, in certain circumstances reading can be a socializing activity. For example, a parent or grandparent reading a story aloud, whether from a traditional printed book or from an e-book, can be a great opportunity for adult and child to share some quiet, relaxed quality time together away from the rush and stresses of the business of daily living. They share a few minutes of precious time, plus they share the ideas that are contained in the story. In addition, older children can be encouraged to read aloud to younger ones as a means of enhancing their relationship. 

At school or at a library story hour, books can bring children together and can be part of a positive shared experience. For some preschoolers this may be their primary opportunity to socialize and to learn how to behave around other children or how to sit quietly for a group activity. Make the most of this experience by encouraging children to talk about what they&#8217;ve read or heard. 

READING CAN IMPROVE HAND-EYE COORDINATION. 

It may sound funny, but e-books can be a way for children to improve their fine motor skills and their hand-eye coordination, as they click around a child-friendly website or click the backward and forward buttons of online story pages. They may also be picking up valuable computer skills that they&#8217;ll need in school and later in life.
