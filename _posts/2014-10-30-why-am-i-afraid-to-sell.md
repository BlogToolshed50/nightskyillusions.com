Relationship marketing. It&#8217;s the backbone of a successful online business. Fail to forge online relationships and your business will suffer. Simple enough concept, right? But what does &#8220;relationship marketing&#8221; really mean? Simply put, it refers to the principle that, in order to be successful in business, especially online since it&#8217;s such an anonymous medium, you need to establish a relationship of trust with your site visitors and ezine readers before you can expect them to do business with you. It requires a commitment to customer service and a willingness to help others for no certain reward other than the satisfaction of helping another and building for yourself and your business a reputation of credibility and trustworthiness.

At the end of the day, though, if your business is to be successful, you have to turn a buck. One of the most common anxieties expressed by new (and even not so new) online entrepreneurs, though, is that they don&#8217;t want to come across as &#8220;selling something&#8221; to those with whom they have forged the very relationship that is a prerequisite to actually making the sale!

In other words, the focus on &#8220;relationship marketing&#8221; has been so much on the relationship that the marketing begins to feel crass and a violation of trust. Many new online business owners report that they feel like they&#8217;re taking advantage of the trust of those with whom they have forged a bond. Of course, there&#8217;s no reason to feel any such thing so long as you believe in what it is you&#8217;re selling and that it&#8217;s something that will benefit your customers. If you don&#8217;t feel this way, then your bad feelings are well placed. You ARE taking advantage!

The discomfort associated with selling is not restricted to the business owner, either. I have received several indignant emails over the course of the past year or so from readers of my ezine in response to promotions I have run for programs I actively promote. The recurring theme of these sorts of communications is that I have a &#8220;responsibility&#8221; to my readers because they&#8217;ve come to rely on me as an authoritative source of information and I have somehow breached this responsibility by doing something so crass as to actually market the programs I promote to earn part of my online income. Some have even gone so far as to suggest that, since I accept paid advertising in my ezine, I should be content with that revenue stream and not seek to make money by promoting outside programs.

My response to this line of reasoning is simply that I&#8217;m running a BUSINESS. I&#8217;m not working nights and weekends on my site and on my ezine out of the goodness of my heart. I&#8217;m just not that noble, believe me. I have a profit motive. Despite what some people seem to think, a profit motive is NOT, in and of itself, a Bad Thing. A profit motive is only a Bad Thing when one misleads, deceives and otherwise takes advantage of the trust of another to pursue that profit. There&#8217;s no reason to apologize or feel guilty for wanting to make an honest profit.

How about you? Do you have just a twinge of uneasiness when it comes to marketing your products and services? Here are some ideas to help you overcome the reticence you may feel in pursuing sales from your prospective customers and how to manage these relationships so that your customer understands that, although you are there to help them, you are also out to help yourself by earning an honest living.
