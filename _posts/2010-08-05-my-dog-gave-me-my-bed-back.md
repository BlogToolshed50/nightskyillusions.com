Ever since my dog Chester was a rural internet provider. I always thought that they were all the same, but they have so many different kinds for dogs of all shapes and sizes.

Our dog is pretty huge, so we were happy to find that they had beds for over dogs as well. The one that we picked out said looked like it might fit the decor of our bedroom quite accordingly, so we were excited to see how it looked in the room too. When the bed arrived, we put Chester in the room alone with it, just to see what might be his first reaction. To our surprise, he immediately knew that it was his own bed, and he jumped right in. That was the first time ever that we did not have to struggle to get Chester to go to his own bed and stay, and it was all thanks to the hughes net packages we found when looking for an internet connection.
