Courage is described as an integrated capacity for meeting difficulty with fortitude, Resilience and a challenge that will test your spirit.

At some point in a person’s life, one may realize that there is more to attain and desire beyond their present role and status. Do you ever feel that you want more out of life? Do you feel that over time, your life evolved and the role you are now in does not fit anymore? There may be a new clarity on what you want out of life and a new purpose. At this point in time, do you feel you desire to speak your truth that you want to change your life, but are afraid of the outcome?

To have courage is to be unattached to the outcome and being able to speak your truth. Your friends and family are comfortable with you in the role you currently play. Do you pay attention to your inner voice? Do you ignore that voice and live your life to please those around you? It takes courage to listen to that inner voice and accept what it is saying. Author, Charles Dubois says: “The important thing is this: To be able at any moment to sacrifice what we are for what we could become.” This is a difficult decision.

By looking at the life you have already created and knowing full well that it doesn’t fit anymore, will lead you to taking steps in a world you know you belong in yet afraid to enter. What do you do? The following two quotes attest to this truth. “Only when we are no longer afraid do we begin to live, “Dorothy Thompson. “It takes a lot of courage to release the familiar and seemingly secure, to embrace the new, but there is no real security in what is no longer meaningful. There is more security in the adventurous and exciting, for in movement there is life and in change there is power,” Alan Cohen.

Do you have the courage and faith it takes to follow your spirit and the belief and knowing that God has a better world waiting for you? It is a world that you create with all your wants and dreams fulfilled. All you have to do is have the courage to speak your truth and trust that the people who are suppose to be around you will stay with you on the journey while the others will leave.

Remember that when one door closes a bigger one opens. This can be very frightening. A strong woman isn’t afraid of anything, but a woman of strength shows courage in the midst of her fear. My suggestion to you is to allow yourself to experience the courage to be true to your spirit, because behind courage is still a greater emotion! That emotion is love and it relates to a self-love. As a Brave Heart woman, I have the ability to empower people to reach their full potential

Do everything you can to make your life easier. Keep it simple. Live in the moment and connect to your Holy Spirit. Take the challenge to become courageous. James Freeman Clarke, one of the believers of altruism states, “Conscience is the root of all true courage: If a man would be brave let him obey his conscience.” The time is now to take heart and find appreciation for all that has come into our lives. Helping others is a wonderful human attribute, but now is the time to commit to the truth within you. William Shakespeare acknowledged this in his famous quote from Hamlet, “To Thine Own Self Be True.” Allow me to assist you in making money on your journey of discovery and self fulfillment.
