Knowing certain aspects of basic legal formalities relevant today to day affairs has assumed significance as I experienced the importance of the same recently. When one of my friends got injured in the road accident, our failure to observe certain legal issues relevant to the claim procedure, has put us at a loss.

One should go in for the services of the solicitor with reasonable experience in such cases. When you meet the solicitors to fight your case the first and foremost thing that you need to establish is the date, time and the venue where your injury was incurred.

Secondly, apart from the time of occurrence of the incident you must be able to bring a witness who can substantiate your claim. This will sure to help you to prove your case strongly though your opponent denies the charge. This will help you a lot in the case of claim made against the sexual harassment and discrimination.

If you have suffered physical injury, it is better that you have the proper medical records on hand for the treatment you had undergone and the Doctor&#8217;s certificate. One can also provide the exact financial loss by duly providing the salary certificate to substantiate the claim due to non attendance to the job owing to the injury.

Any laxity to on our part to adhere to such basic things can end in loss while making the claim at the time of any injury.
