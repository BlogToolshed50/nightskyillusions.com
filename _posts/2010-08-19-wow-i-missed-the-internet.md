Thanks to Rod Riojas for the guest post

After three years of living in rural areas of Costa Rica in Central America, I finally moved to a place where I could have internet access and satellite tv in my home again, and wow! Iâ€™ve gotta say, I really missed having webcam and see my family. And now I can catch episodes I&#8217;ve missed of my favorite shows when they air and even watch movies. I was getting so tired of watching and rewatching my limited collection of DVDs. Now it&#8217;s like the whole world is open to me as soon as I turn on my computer. And when I can&#8217;t remember something like the name of an actor I saw in a movie or when someone poses a question like &#8220;What&#8217;s the deal with canola oil?&#8221; I can search the answer online instead of wondering about it all night, and if you know me, you know I&#8217;m one of those people that keeps turning a thing like that over in my brain until I go crazy if I don&#8217;t come up with the answer. I know it&#8217;s silly, but I gotta say it&#8217;s nice to just search it online, and bam!, there&#8217;s the answer.
