There may be instances in the international trade where in the exporter transfers his right to receive payment in favor of a forfeiture. This transaction is called as &#8220;forfeiting&#8221;. The forfeiture may be a bank and waives the recourse to the exporter if the importer defaults in payment. It is found to be more appropriate in the case of medium or large export contract involving medium term credit. Normally four parties are involved in this transaction namely, exporter, importer, guarantor and the forfeiture.

The goods and services to be supplied by the exporter are to be paid for by the purchaser by the issue of a debt instrument like promote or BOE underwritten by guarantor and sold to forfeiture on discount. Three elements of cost that is discounted rate or rate of interest, commitment fee and option fee are involved in a forfeiting transaction. In fact, the exporter is benefited by receiving his payment and the importer too gets the benefit of meeting out his obligation. When the forfeiture buys the export receivables, he undertakes the inherent political and commercial risks involved in international trade.
