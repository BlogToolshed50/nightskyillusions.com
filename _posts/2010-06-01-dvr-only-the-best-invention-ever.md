I love my DVR. I record all of my favorite shows and blast right through commercials. I will even wait until a show is recorded before I watch it, just so I can fast forward through commercials. I think the DVR is truly one of the best inventions out there! I first learned about DVRs when researching satellite tv vs cable. I never miss a show and I don&#8217;t have to pick between two shows that are on at the same time. It&#8217;s genius and so easy to use my DVR with satellite TV. As soon as it was installed it was ready to go. All I had to do was start programming my favorite shows.

The shows I love to record are House, Frasier, The Office, and then of course all of my court TV shows. I love watching Divorce Court and a lot of other shows like that. I know shows like these aren&#8217;t high quality TV, but hey I love it anyway. Another show I love to record on my DVR is 24. That show is amazing and I&#8217;m really sad it ended, but with my DVR I can find any reruns and record them. Now I don&#8217;t have to pick and choose what I want to watch. DVR&#8217;s are especially useful when you have a new baby at home. I can just pause my shows instead of missing important dialogue.
