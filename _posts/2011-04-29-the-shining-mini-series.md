Guest post of the week by Bradley Guthrie

When nfl Sunday ticket and I wanted to get shows like The Shining we decided to make the switch to Directv and we sure are glad we did. Anyway, The Shining is one of my favorite Stephen King books and one of my favorite movies. It is always a little strange when a great movie is re-done and you have to wonder what else could possibly be done in the new version that wasn&#8217;t done in the original. However, The Shining mini series went above and beyond anything I could have expected. It stayed more true to the book and the entire book was covered since it was a multiple part series. I always liked Steven Weber, but I was curious as to how he was going to play this part. I had mainly seen him in a comedic role on the tv show Wings, so wasn&#8217;t sure how he was going to handle playing a crazed husband in the movie. But, the performance was truly spectacular. He was able to bring so much to the character and not play the character the same as Jack Nicholson originally. He made the character his for the movie.
