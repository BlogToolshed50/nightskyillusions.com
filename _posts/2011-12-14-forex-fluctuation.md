The recent unexpected fluctuation in the matter of foreign exchange came as a shock to so many countries in the wake of global financial crisis. Adding fuel to the fire, the recession in the European zone and the banking crisis elsewhere too resulted in the weakening of the currency in different countries leading to the high import cost and the increased inflation. The depreciation in the currency in the light of the forex instability, has made the imports costly and the imported inflation has aggravated the price level of various commodities. In fact, the currency weakness has been observed heavily in the Asian region, who import bill became fat and the trade balance becoming out of bounds.

As a measure of mitigating the problem, the central bank of different nations intervene in the forex market to reduce the flexibility. But the resultant liquidity infusion in the system adds to the inflationary pressure impacting the macro economic programs and resulting in the social unrest. The best way to tackle the issue is to increase the flow of the needed forex into the country through policy measures to ease the foreign investment in a country in the long-term projects and increasing the exports and inward remittances. In all, appropriate and timely measures to balance the supply and demand of the forex alone can avoid the unwarranted forex fluctuation.
