Without a doubt, the internet has made getting accurate exchange rate data a lot easier for everyone. It can be tricky to find these things out when you are on the move, unless you take your laptop into a Wi-Fi enabled cafe or head to the library, which is not always practical. If, however, you are the lucky owner of a smart-phone such as an HTC Magic or a Blackberry, then there is an easy way of obtaining accurate exchange rate data on the go, simply by downloading and installing a currency converter app.

If you have a Blackberry, try giving World mate Live, available for free from the newly launched Blackberry App World service, a whirl.First, you are going to have to download App World to your Blackberry, which should take no more than ten minutes, and requires a trackball and software of version 4.2 or higher in order to function correctly. After you have installed App World, go into it and search for World-mate Live. After downloading, it should take around three minutes or so to set up.

As well as keeping you up to date with the movements of over a hundred and sixty currencies, it can also provide you with weather reports for anywhere in the world, itinerary organizers, and even a handy comparison chart for international clothing sizes.

If you have a T Mobile G1 phone, then you might want to give a Currency a go. It is completely free, only takes a minute or so to install, and can give you up to date info on more than a hundred and sixty currencies.

The easiest way to get it is to download it straight onto your phone from the Android Market, which is very similar to the i Tunes App Store. You should be able to find it fairly easily by searching for the keyword Currency and then looking for the currency download from there.The best thing about a Currency is that it always shows you the current exchange rates without requiring any manual updating on your part.

Windows Mobile-equipped smart-phones, such as the Sam-sung Blackjack or the Motorola Q are able to get their own version of the Blackberry app Worldwide Live, although the procedure is quite different.

You can download this by surfing to world-mate.com and electing to receive this app on your phone via a link in a text message or e-mail. As with the Blackberry version, it takes around ten minutes to download and set up, but after that you are good to go.

Due to the fact that these programs all obtain their currency information from the internet, it stands to reason that if you are in a part of the world where you cannot get reception, then your currency information is unlikely to be up to date, so if you need accurate information, then make sure that you are connected when you check.
