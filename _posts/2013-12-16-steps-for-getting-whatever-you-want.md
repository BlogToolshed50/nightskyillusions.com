I&#8217;ve discovered that there are four simple core principles at the heart of the creation process in getting whatever you want by doing the following four steps to achieve any goal you have.

1. STEP ONE: KNOW WHAT YOU WANT
  
Yes, it seems so obvious, doesn&#8217;t it? You must know what you want in order to get what you want. Yet this most basic first step is missed by the majority of people. You must know what you want as specifically as possible. Daydreaming about your future will not bring you what you want. The only way to get what you want is to decide with clarity and focus exactly what you want to create.

So how do you know what you want? Simply, write down your desires, your dreams, and everything that you want for your life. Then pick the one thing on your list that you know you could accomplish if you dedicated some energy to it and forget about the rest. Then, focus, focus, and focus. Don&#8217;t waste your energy wishing and dreaming for a million and one things; so, just pick one. Just as the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, the journey to your ideal life also begins with a single goal. Begin with an easy, do-able goal that you have not unaccomplished. Write down as specifically and exactly what it is you want and will create. After it&#8217;s finished, move on to the next goal.

2. STEP TWO: FOCUS ON WHAT YOU WANT
  
You must give positive focused thought, energy, and attention to your goal. You must imprint it on your conscious and subconscious mind until it becomes reality. Remember, thought is blindingly fast compared to the manifestation of thoughts into reality. As you practice this method and become more confident your thoughts will come into reality much more quickly.

You must keep your energy, intention, and attention directly on your goal. You must focus on what you want, not on what you DON’T want. Stop complaining about things that are not the way you want them to be. Instead, decide how you would like them to be and focus on that. Take a look at your goal every day; give it positive focus and attention. Before you fall asleep and after you wake up, instead of worrying about your problems, imagine your goal successfully attained. “FEEL” how you would feel if your goal was already accomplished. Go to sleep with this feeling and your subconscious mind will quickly find a way to bring it into your reality.

3. STEP THREE: TAKE ACTION NOW!
  
You must take action towards your goal and you must take action right now! Making plans to take action is not action. It doesn&#8217;t matter how tiny the action is or how insignificant you might feel it is; you must take action NOW with some small step.

You must convince your subconscious mind that you are serious about accomplishing your goal and there is nothing more convincing than taking action. No matter where you are along your path to your goal, no matter how near or far you might feel your goal is, there is always an obvious next step you can take. Take that step in this present moment right now!

If your goal is truly out of your hands, you need a new goal. Waiting for other people to change or give you what you want is a sure way to always be unsatisfied. You must pick a goal you are in control of and do whatever it takes to make it come true. That is the only path to power and mastery in life; and the only way to ever feel fulfilled.

4. STEP FOUR: CHOOSE THE SAME THING EVERY DAY
  
You must be consistent. You must, consistently, choose the same goal every day until your goal is accomplished. You cannot send out constantly changing vague wishes into the universe and expect to create results in the real world. You must decide what you want and then ask for it. If you do not provide the universe with a specific goal which you consistently take action toward; it will never come to you. And the most important secret of all, DON’T GIVE UP UNTIL YOUR GOAL IS ACCOMPLISHED.
