Have you ever wondered why e-books are so popular? Could anyone write and publish one? These are a couple of questions that we will answer today.

Nowadays you can find e-books everywhere on the internet. There are even libraries where you can download them directly to your computer. While some e-books are free, because they are in public domain, there are some that are written specifically to boost advertising.

It is well known that everyday people log on to the internet in search of information and the best way of giving it to them is through e-books as they are quickly and easily delivered. Their contribution to the marketplace is one of the forerunning advertisement methods in use today.

How to use e-books to promote your business?

When you offer free e-books to those people who visit your site you are allowing them to know more about the product/service you are promoting. By writing on a topic that you are familiar with you set yourself as an authority in your particular field. 

Surely you are wondering how to get an e-book written for your customers to help boost the traffic and sales of your website. Can anyone write an E-Book ? YES. Even if you consider you don’t have what it takes to be a writer, if you try you’ll see that it is not that difficult. The main idea is to write about something you are familiar with, to find the perfect niche for your business. If you love video games, then write about video games; if you are good at fishing write about fishing techniques – you get the picture. When the readers see that you are an expert they will develop a trust in you and they will be more eager to do business with you.

After your e-book is finished all you have to do is convert it to a PDF format. You can use any PDF converters that are available on the internet.
  
Now that you have this knowledge I recommend getting started as quickly as possible. Remember – Time is Money
