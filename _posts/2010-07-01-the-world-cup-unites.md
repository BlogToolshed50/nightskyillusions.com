As I tune in to all the World Cup games with some of the best cable tv offers through my Satellite TV, it occurs to me that there are many parts of the Cup that bring joy to people around the world. Some watch because they love the game. Others watch because of their patriotism. Still more watch because of the intensity of the players and the brawls that break out. All of these reasons attract me as well, but there is one purpose above all others that makes me want to watch the World Cup.

In a world where war is everywhere, the environment is being destroyed, and political systems are crumbling from their corruption, there is little left to make us feel like the world will hold together much longer.

Then, every four years, the global atmosphere shifts. Suddenly countries from everywhere come together, countries that have little hope elsewhere become champions, and the superpower that is the United States becomes the underdog that is cast aside even by its own people. The world&#8217;s playing field is, quite literally, leveled.

The Olympics are thought to be the event that brings the world together, and they do that. They do not, however, have the pull and promise of the footballers that come together every four years, bred on behalf of their country to conquer, but also to unite.
