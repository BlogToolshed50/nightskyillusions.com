Guest post written by Hannah Long

Moving to New York City was something I dreamed about since my family vacationed there the summer before I started the fifth grade. I was mystified that people actually lived there because it was so unlike the small town where we lived. Then in college I started considering it seriously and used some connections that I had to land a full-time book publishing internship after graduation.

My internship is about to come to a close and I’m going on a few interviews for full-time salaried positions over the next few weeks. So far I’ve been sticking to my train that I ride to and from work and rarely venturing off of that route unless I’m with someone who knows where they’re going. I’ve been using Direct TV Satellite Internet Service for a good while to check directions for anywhere I’m going.

I don’t think that finding these interview spots will be a problem, now I just have to decide what to wear.
