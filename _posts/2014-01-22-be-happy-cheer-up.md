To help someone cheer up and be happy is one of the simplest gifts that one human being can give to another. A person who is sad or worried will not function at their best. By helping them cheer up, we empower the recipient while receiving the blessings of friendship and goodwill. The person who is cheered up feels happy, so does the one giving cheer. The great thinkers and teachers have dwelt on this subject. They emphasize the importance of giving cheer as a way to be happy despite our own circumstances. It is the happy and cheerful people that become the source of happiness and encouragement for those around them.

There are many ways to cheer up another soul. The following story illustrates how color can be used as a tool to help cheer people experiencing a loss. A lady visiting a family which had experienced a recent bereavement chose to wear bright clothes instead of the sober ones which is the norm on such occasions for that particular culture. Some of the attendees questioned the lady about her judgment. The lady acknowledged she was taking a risk but felt convinced that the brighter colors would be effective in helping the immediate family cheer up. If she wore mourning clothes they would only be reminded of the tragedy. She wanted to remind them that past their mourning there would be hope and peace. To the surprise of the attendees who had questioned the ladyâ€™s choice, the immediate family not only did not take offense but welcomed the sight. It is not suggested here that this is the only way or the best way to cheer up a person. One has to be innovative and think of the circumstances and context of the situation. But if convinced by your inner being, the choice will be easy to make.

News of troubled economic time and violence across the globe give even more reasons for the need to cheer up those that we are in contact with. An unhappy person is prone to over-think their situation and risk spiraling into depression. You will never know how much a simple gesture can help a person cheer up and get them back on their feet. When we do so, we help ourselves cheer up and be happy.
