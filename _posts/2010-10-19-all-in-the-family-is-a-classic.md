Thanks for the post from Heriberto Sanders

How many people out there do you think still have a family tradition of getting together once per week to watch direct tv. It&#8217;s the same routine every time. I go over there, set the table, we eat, I clear the table, and then we all remain in the kitchen to watch All In The Family.

My father always comments on how things back then weren&#8217;t that different from today. I counter by saying that, &#8220;Yeah, the iPod, internet, and cell phones were all really popular back then.&#8221; This is just to give him a little verbal jab. He doesn&#8217;t mind. It&#8217;s a father and son thing. If he doesn&#8217;t care for it, I&#8217;m not aware of it.

If you have never seen All In The Family, I would recommend giving it a try. It has withstood the test of time for a reason.
