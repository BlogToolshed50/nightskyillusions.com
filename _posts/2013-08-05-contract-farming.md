It may not be far away that the world is going to reach a point of food insecurity. Yes, if the present state of affair is continued in the agricultural front for the years to come, sooner or latter we may face the food shortage and famine. In the countryside the farmers are facing numerous problems to keep the farming activity going on.

Non availability of labor, un-remunerative price for the commodities produced coupled with monsoon failure add to the misery of the farmers. It is high time that the corporate houses enter into this sector and help the farmers to do farming profitably.

Contract farming is the best solution for linking the business houses and the individual farmers in the locality. As a measure of backward linkage to get the needed raw materials for the production the industrial units like textiles can think of going in for the contract farming to produce cotton. In the same line if the related agriculture farming is done on contract basis with the farmers by the corporates, the farming activity can be sustained to certain extent to ensure the food security.
