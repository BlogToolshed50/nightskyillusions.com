Written by my friend Constance Hayden

With school starting earlier this year than last year, it seems as if I do not have enough time to get everything together. Unlike surrounding school districts, the school I attend does not provide a shopping list from which I can easily identify and buy the required items. Thus, the typical shopping experience can be a bit daunting.

After setting my alarm devices, I head to my car to begin my supply hunt. The most obvious supplies are easily obtainable, such as paper, pencils, and pens. At this time, I go to Wal-Mart to pick those items up quickly. While there, I also grabbed 3-4 easy-page-tear notebooks, as I do not know how much writing I will have to do. This year, I will be taking a science class which required lab goggles. Wal-Mart did not have any, so I went to Target and Office Depot, but with no luck. Then I remembered, town I live in has a college campus, which might have goggles for sale. I called ahead, and what luck! I was able to pick up goggles for about $6.00. I did not buy anything else at the store, as most of the items seemed overpriced.

To finish up my trip, I had to first get to Wal-Mart again, as I forgot to buy colored pencils and several folders. Altogether, my supplies were about $30.00 in price, but I believe I have enough to last for the entire year. That is, unless my teachers decide to be evil and require 5 pages of notes everyday!
