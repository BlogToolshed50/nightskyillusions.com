Although more than 90 per cent of Canadian family doctors feel that the combination of wearing a wide brimmed hat in conjunction with sunscreen is an effective method of protection against the sun&#8217;s rays, only 21 per cent of Canadians wear a wide brimmed hat every time they go outdoors, according to a recent poll of Canadian family doctors and the general population. Surprising news, considering that the poll also showed that 94 per cent of Canadians feel it is important to protect their skin against the sun&#8217;s rays, including 73 per cent who feel it is very important.

&#8220;Even though we live in Canada, everyone should still be protecting their skin against the sun&#8217;s rays,&#8221; says Dr. Charlene Linzon, dermatologist. &#8220;Skin diseases caused by sun exposure in Canada are on the rise, yet Canadians remain reluctant to practice proper sun safety measures.&#8221;

Doctors know best

Despite ongoing education efforts, Canadians are not making sun safety practices part of their everyday lives. Family doctors continue to see many patients with skin conditions as a result of sun exposure, according to the poll. As a result of exposure to the sun, doctors most often see sunburns (61 per cent), skin cancer (49 per cent), and premature aging or wrinkles (40 per cent). Doctors say that an average of 71 per cent of these conditions could be avoided if patients use sun protection such as sunscreen in conjunction with a wide brimmed hat.

&#8220;Despite awareness of the dangers of sun exposure &#8211; even when outside for only a short time or on a cloudy day &#8211; people still think that sunburns can&#8217;t happen to them. It&#8217;s also surprising how many adults don&#8217;t take the time to protect themselves, even if they do practice sun safety with their kids,&#8221; says Dr. Linzon. &#8220;By simply avoiding peak sun hours, and using simple sun safety measures such as applying effective sunscreens and wearing wide brimmed hats &#8211; which dramatically reduce the harmful impact of the sun&#8217;s rays &#8211; Canadians can safely enjoy time spent outdoors.&#8221;
