The human race is fighting against all the odds to thrive and prosper. So many revolutions are taking place in different fields and the technological improvement and innovations have become handy to go against the wave. In developing countries like Kenya, Philippines, South Africa and India, the mobile banking plan is in a big way to reach the un banked people.

Mobile banking done with the co ordination between the banking sector and the telecommunication departments is certain to help the common man to do the banking business sitting at home rather than visiting the bank branch.

Mobile banking can facilitate the deposit, withdrawal and the payment apart from certain miscellaneous services. In developing country like India, the monthly addition of the Mobile is to the tune of 1.20 Crore sets which speaks volume about the opportunity that can be offered through the Mobile banking.

The total financial inclusion can be easily achieved through the Mobile banking and the benefits of transparency of the banking transactions can be reaped by the Governments also to collect the legitimate tax.
