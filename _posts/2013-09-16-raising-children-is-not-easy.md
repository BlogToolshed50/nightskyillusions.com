The idea of having children and raising them has been promoted as a wonderful lifestyle, and even as a woman’s duty. But if you can’t afford this so called wonderful lifestyle it can be a hell. If you look around you and see all the unwed mothers struggling to raise their children without any one to help them, you will agree with me.

The people that are encouraging those that can’t afford to have children, to have them anyway, are committing a great disservice to the parents by giving them the wrong information. They must realize that it cost money to raise a child, and if a woman is not in the financial position to have one, it is reckless and irresponsible behavior to bring a child into this world.

There are many things that people will like to have like: automobiles, expensive vacations, and new homes, they are nice to have if you can afford them. Children are also nice to have, but the same rule should apply. There is nothing in this world that is free and that includes the clean air, it is obtained by expensive anti-pollution systems.
  
It is of no use repeating what is happening to children that don’t have the advantage of having parents that can give them the guidance and financial support they need to help better themselves. The only way to make it easier for the children of the future is to make sure that they will have parents that can take care of them. The government must let people that are thinking of having a child know what danger lies ahead if they can’t afford to have one. If that message is clear, no woman or man will dare try to have a child if they are not capable of giving that child what it needs.

The preachers of morality claim that they love children and would like all mothers to produce as many of them as possible, they say that: “The Lord Will Provide”. This is not happening and they are giving out false information. Ask any poor mother if anyone is providing for her in a hellish world, her answer will be: “NOBODY”. Those that sincerely care for children don’t want them to suffer in a household with hardly any food to eat or clothing to wear. Honest and caring people will warn potential parents of what lies ahead if they are not prepared for the responsibility of having a child.
