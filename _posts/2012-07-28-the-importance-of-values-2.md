I am sure that a large part of the reason that you are reading this article right now is because you want to be a success and if you are a coach yourself you want to help your clients succeed too. It is true that the definition of success may be different for every person; however, the real evidence of success essentially is portrayed in who you are right now and who you are becoming. The source of this success is determined by your values. So it is so important to find a way to clarify your values which determine the very nature of your own personal success.

When you know what your values are it does provide you with a head start for making better choices and decisions. Such choices are ones that serve you best, choices that help you to live in alignment with whom you are and who you want to be. They are choices that take you closer to where you want to be and not ones that lead you further away from the point you want to reach. Values are standards by which you choose to live your life by to the best of your ability every day. And by so doing they enable you to focus on what is really important in your life. The natural outcome of living and practicing your values is a life full of joy, excitement, inspiration, harmony, balance and a sense of peace. It, however, does not mean that every day will be stress and problem-free. Realistically, life is full of challenges, but by living according to your values, each event, happening roadblock or slight deviation in plans becomes a little if not a lot easier to manage and becomes a lot less challenging.
  
If you really want to change something in your life and succeed, you need to get serious about your values. Until you determine what your values are, it is impossible to live the way you want in a way that is long-lasting. Success only comes as a result of having values and practicing them at every opportunity. As Albert Einstein said; Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.&#8221;
  
Values fundamentally shape your behaviors, choices and decisions in life. If you go through your days without knowing what your values are, how can you create the kind of life you want for yourself? Thus, it is important to determine your values first to support a clear vision of what it is that you really desire to be able to live the kind of life you dream of.

Values are often overlooked. More emphasis is placed on goals and achieving them. I am not saying that dreams and goals are not important, but what is a goal worth if it is not based on what is important and valuable to you? Goals that are determined by motivations other than ones that are true for you end up feeling and being meaningless. That is the reason why so many people feel empty after having reached a goal that they thought they genuinely wanted. It is because the value of the goal itself is not in alignment with what is valued. If for example one of your values in life is adventure, but you aim for and get a job or relationship that is very stable and offers you security and safety, there will come a time when you will become very unhappy because the relationship or job does not meet what you value, namely adventure and risk-taking. This could be the other way round too of course.
  
When you confirm and address what you value in yourself, in others, in your work, for your health, for the environment and for your own spiritual journey you can then create the lifestyle of your choice. They determine what your building blocks or choices for success will be. Determining your values encourages you strongly to listen to your inner voice and to do what the heart really wants.

Do you know what your values are? If you are not sure, take some time out and write down in order of priority what standards or values are most important and valuable to you in your life. Do not be surprised if they are different to what you thought they were or what they were 5 years or even 1 year ago. Values DO and are meant to change as you grow develop.
