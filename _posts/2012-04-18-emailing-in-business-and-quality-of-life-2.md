Communication in earlier days &#8211; There was a time when during prehistoric times, people used to communicate in sign languages. Today most of us talk to each other through a short SMS. Times have changed. Have human beings changed? Have our basic desires changed? No!

About the modern world

How to live in this modern world and still maintain close contact that touches the heart, while using latest technology? Every communication need not be heart to heart. A simple business mail needs to be precise and to the point. But what about our communication with our friends, and family? Even business needs communication that talks the language of heart. Look at the successful advertisements. You will find that the company is trying to touch the consumer hearts. Study any close business relationship, and you will find that the relationship has crossed the &#8220;to the point talk&#8221; of business and reached heart to heart talk between the buyer and the supplier. Communication for better relationships- For long lasting relationships and for living a satisfied life, we need to communicate with everyone we come across in the language that is dear to all of us. That is the language that touches the heart! How to do that? Can that be done?

Writing and answering emails

Emails are the most popular and common method of communication in today&#8217;s world. Most of us, who are otherwise not on our computer all the day, try to find some time to check our mails and answer them. Emails have become preferred method and a second habit, rather an essential part of a modern person. How do we talk to each other on emails? Some of us are very brief where as some others believe in writing long paragraphs to send a small message. It is same as our behavior in other areas of life. Those who believe in speaking less, write short answers and mails. Our habits carry themselves in our method of writing mails. But the habit of sending short mails is becoming more prevalent. Why brief mails ? Why it is that brief mails are becoming more common? Is it because most of us are finding no time to talk. We are always so busy and rushed that gone are the days when people used to sit down and write their text after deep thought. For a majority of young population, the main task is to finish answering all the mails as soon as possible. How does one talk heart to heart in such a life? This reflects our lifestyle in the modern world. Most of us want to achieve our goals as soon as possible. No one has the time to sit back and reflect. Life is becoming a prisoner of work. Even our ancestors used to work, but are we living a satisfied life such as they used to? The answer would be no. Brief writing habit is part of the deterioration in quality life.
