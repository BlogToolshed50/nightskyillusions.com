It may be no surprise to hear that negative thinking is one of the reasons for under achievement. Your life is built on your self image and that image will depend on what you tell yourself. When you choose (and you do choose) to engage in negative thinking you are deciding to believe in your inability rather than your possibility. But it’s not just you!

There will be plenty of people in your life who are all ready, willing and eager to spread the doom and gloom over why things just won’t work. Or why you are just not capable of achieving what you hope to. Unfortunately family and friends can be the worst culprits! They will always willingly let you know why you will fail. Why it won’t work out.

Having said that it is important to recognize that at times your nearest and dearest will be the first to shower negative rains on your dreams because they want to protect you from failing. Sometimes they may be afraid of you developing, growing and leaving them behind. There will always be a deep underlying fear in the negative thoughts of another.

The most important thing you can do in an effort to avoid under achievement is to learn to protect yourself from the naysayers. Other people’s opinion of you is none of your business! I have no idea who said that originally but it’s spot on. Instead of taking on board what others have to say focus on learning how to develop the inner strength needed to achieve your dreams.

Negative messages from other people can only affect you if you allow them to. Learn to brush them off. It’s time to become stronger about who you are and what you stand for.

Before tackling others though it is important you tackle yourself if you want to avoid under achievement. What do you think about yourself right now and how is that affecting the accomplishments of your goals?

Awareness, acknowledgment and acceptance are the key towards changing the negative conversations that rattle around in your mind.
