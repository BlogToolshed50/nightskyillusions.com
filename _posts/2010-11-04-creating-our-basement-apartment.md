Our kids are grown and have been living on their own for a while, but until about a year ago our basement still served as storage for all their junk they couldn’t move with them across the country. My husband had had enough of it a long time ago and wanted to use the area as an extra living space.

So we told our kids that if their stuff wasn’t gone in two months, we were trashing it. Of course they came and found a lot of their high school sports memorabilia that they assumed were lost because they were in piles of boxes. After they cleared what they wanted and helped us dispose of what they didn’t, our daughter suggested that we turn it into a basement apartment and rent it out for a little extra cash to put toward our impending retirement.

I thought it sounded like a great idea so I visited kitchnette and make sure the area had proper heating and cooling systems.

A nice graduate student has moved in and we’re enjoying the pocket change and the game night we have with him every week.
