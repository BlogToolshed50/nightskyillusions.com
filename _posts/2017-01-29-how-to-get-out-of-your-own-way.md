1. Face Facts: YOU may just be the bump in the road that's slowing you down.

Often the most difficult step in getting out of one's own way is recognizing that you are indeed, in it. When you encounter problems in achieving your goals, carefully consider whether or not you are the source of those problems.

2. You can do anything you want. However, you may not be able to do everything you want.

Most of the time we get in our own ways by trying to do too much all at once. By working hard at trying to do everything we end up accomplishing very little. Concentrating on one or two projects at a time will actually increase your chances getting what you want.

3. To get a clear picture, you've got to focus.

Once you know which project(s) you will tackle, you must focus on what it will take to really do those projects. Create step-by-step plans for what you will do and when you will do them.

4. If it's on paper, it's a plan. If it's in your head, it's a dream.

Many are reluctant to actually put their plans down on paper. Putting plans to paper is the first physical step to take towards achieving one's desires. Without a written plan most people will start a project but soon be distracted by the many little things that pop up.

5. Just because you're moving doesn't mean you're getting ahead.

A sure sign of a person getting in their own way is when they are working very hard, but not getting any closer to achieving their goals. (This is also one of the most frequent effects of not having a written plan.) To move forward you must take the proper actions at the proper times.

6. Not choosing IS choosing.

Another roadblock we create is by over-thinking our options to the point of inactivity. "I could do A, B, or C" we tell ourselves. "I better think about it." Then we proceed to ponder.... but we never actually decide. What we're really doing, though, is deciding to do nothing. But guess what? If you do nothing, you get nothing.

7. Concentrate on what will work.

Some people are very good at finding all of the reasons why something *won't* work. So good that they talk themselves out of even trying. Don't compound potential negatives, compound the positives and concentrate on why things *will* work for you!

8. If it's not working, STOP DOING IT!

One definition of insanity reads: "Doing the same thing over and over, but expecting a different result each time." I tend to think of that more as a definition of *humanity.* Whether caused by determination, pride, or mere stubbornness, many have trouble recognizing and admitting that things aren't working. If that's you, adopt a new motto: "Just don't do it!" When things stop working, stop doing them, readjust, and move on.

9. When you just don't know, get help.

We can't know everything. We can't always solve everything. When that's the case, get help. There are businesses, counselors, consultants, and coaches who can work with you on almost any trouble spot you may encounter. Use them.

10. If it doesn't make you happyScience Articles, don't do it.

Working towards your goals may not always be easy. You may not have fun every moment as you wend your way. Overall you should be happy with what you are doing because it's what you want to do. If that's not true then you definitely need to re-evaluate your goals or how you are pursuing them.
