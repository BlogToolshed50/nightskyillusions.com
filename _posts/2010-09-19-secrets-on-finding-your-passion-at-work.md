Finding your passion at work is the key to ensure lifelong happiness, contentment and good health. When you love what you do, it matters less how much money you have in the bank. You look forward each day that comes with zest and excitement. You feel your work and everything else in life is full of adventure, opportunities and satisfaction. You are at your best health, you sleep well, and you feel rejuvenated and inspired. 

Russian author Fyodor Dostoyevsky had similar opinions on this effect on a working individual. While he was in prison for expressing negative views against the authorities, he was moved by the misery of prisoners who were tasked to transfer a huge pile of sand all day. He had observed that this group of prisoners was the one who tried to escape thru the electrified barbed-wire fence or committed suicide. The other group of prisoners on the other hand was tasked to build a railroad. They appear to be happier and satisfied, in fact he had heard them singing while at work. 

To find passion at work, you must be in the right job where you are given the freedom to become a better and wiser person than you are at the present.
  
And to find the right job, you must be honest with your feelings and thoughts. You must know the things that matter to you and that will really make you happy and content. Take time to incorporate your thoughts and feelings, your sense of individuality, your weaknesses, strengths, the thing that annoy you, excites you, and what you do effortlessly and naturally. Knowing what you want and having the courage to go for it helps your mind and feelings accomplish your objective. 

You must also make sure that the work you have provides your needs. Many people quit their jobs because they feel unappreciated, too busy and drained (signs of poor boundaries), unchallenged, and more. It is important for you to examine your needs as it is similar to having the right nutrients in your diet. Fine-tuning your personal needs with the rewards of work gives you security and contentment. Thus, making you more inspired and motivated.
