My family has an early fall tradition of ice blocking. The first weekend of fall, we all meet at the park in our hometown for some ice blocking fun. The laughs we share and hours together are priceless.

We start out the day by packing a picnic. We load up the picnic goodies, pack a few towels and chairs, set the home security alarm I found at www.Inhomesecurity.com and out the door we go. On the way to the park, we all buy blocks of ice. You can find them anywhere you buy bags of ice. They are very inexpensive and you can share the blocks. We usually buy 2 or 3 per family group.

If you have never been ice blocking, believe me, it&#8217;s a blast. The idea is to slide down a hill sitting on the block of ice. We have races to see who goes the fastest and farthest. The kids enjoy the sliding. As the day wears on, the blocks melt and become slippery. Being that it is early fall, it is warm enough to enjoy the activity but not hot enough to melt the ice too quickly. That single block of ice will last hours.

We spend quality family time together each fall doing this. We enjoy an outdoor activity, the company of family and a picnic all in one day. It&#8217;s a great tradition we all enjoy.
