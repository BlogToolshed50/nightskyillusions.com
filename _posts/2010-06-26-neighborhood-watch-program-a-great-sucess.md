Thanks to guest writer Larry Mercier for the post

As the years have gone by it has become more important to take the proper measures to protect my home and my family, so I started searching for an alarm service around Indianapolis. I never had put much thought into it until the last few years. I feel much safer knowing that the home alarm system keeps me protected all of the time.

The neighborhood has ran a very successful Neighborhood Watch Program for the last three years as well. There are a few minor quirks in it, but overall it is a terrific program that I am proud to say is in place in my neighborhood. As a team we are able to work with the local law enforcement officials to implement trouble areas and concerns that we have. If the police were to become a bit more involved our program could run much better.

Other than that, the program is flawless. Every single person in the neighborhood helps in the feat to keep us safe by doing his or her part. We have great volunteers who devout their time to ensuring a successful program. All in all I think the Neighborhood Watch Program is a helpful tool in keeping my neighborhood safe. I can rest soundly at night knowing those around me are looking out for me,too.
