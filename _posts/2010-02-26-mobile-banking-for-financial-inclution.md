So many revolutions are taking place in different fields and the technological improvement and innovations have become handy to go against the wave. In developing countries like Kenya, Philipines, South Africa and India, the mobile banking plan is in a big way to reach the un banked people.

Mobile banking done with the co ordination between the banking sector and the telecommunication departments is certain to help the common man to do the banking business sitting at home rather than visiting the bank branch.

In developing country like India, the monthly addition of the Mobile is to the tune of 1.20 Crore sets which speaks volume about the opportunity that can be offered through the Mobile banking.
