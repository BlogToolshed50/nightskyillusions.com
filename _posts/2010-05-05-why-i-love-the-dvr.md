Thanks to my friend Alice Lee for the guest post.

With a family of 7, a DVR was a dream come true in my home. The children, who range in ages of 7 to 17, both boy and girl, all have different tastes and likes. The family room features a large screen flat panel, high definition television that everyone likes to watch their shows on. But since everyone likes something different ,it is not possible for everyone to catch what they want.

With the DVR my children can record their shows and enjoy them in the Family Room anytime they want. My youngest is stuck on &#8220;iCarly&#8221;right now, and this is what she seems to record most of the time. My oldest daughter seems to be engaged to MTV. She records so many programs off of that station. My Sweet 16 is one of the most recorded.I&#8217;m even starting to enjoy the show! Of course the youngest is in love with Transformers, Spiderman, and Batman, and the DVR often records these cartoons and movies for him.
