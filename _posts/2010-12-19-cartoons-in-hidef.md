Guest post of the week by Val Flores

There is nothing better than watching cartoons in high definition on the Bugs Bunny right through the screen. My son loves to watch cartoons in HiDef, he says it makes the characters seem more life like. I think it has more to do with the fact that he is watching them on the big screen and Speedy Gonzalez is the size of him.

No matter what cartoon he is watching, he says that they are so much better now that we aren&#8217;t using regular cable or the converter box. It seems that the converter had more issues that when we had to use the rabbit ears. Even the adult cartoons that my husband and I watch look better. They are much more clear than they ever were before. I don&#8217;t think that we will ever go back to cable television again, with a picture as crystal clear as this, there is no need&#8211; we&#8217;ve been spoiled and would never go back.
