It is the matter of great concern that, the human being is knowingly spoiling the nature for their own well-being and growth. Hitherto, the degree of pollution was on the earthen surface and now it is accelerating in the ocean as well. The recent study conducted by the scientists in US has indicated that the noise level in the ocean is increasing.

Normally, the noise in the ocean is created due to the marine lives, shipping and rain. This sound is absorbed and reduced due to the viscosity of the water and certain chemicals available in the water.

When the pollution level is increasing, the acidity level in the water goes up along with the increase in the level of carbon di-oxide. This is due to the increased shipping activities in the ocean which has gone up in multitude in the recent times.

It is estimated that by the year 2100, the chemicals present in the ocean will have the capacity to reduce the noise to the extent of 60% only and this will lead to the disturbances in the marine life. Even the coral formation will be affected to the study, due to the depletion in the Calcium level due to the pollution.

It is high time that the society thinks to safeguard the nature and protect the human being from the ill effects of such degradation.
