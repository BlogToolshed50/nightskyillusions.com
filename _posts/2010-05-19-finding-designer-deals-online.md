I am a shopping fiend – especially when it comes to finding deals on designer duds on the Internet. But I can’t give myself all the credit.

There are so many websites now a days that specialize in finding designer clothing and goods that have marked-down prices. Basically any brand from Betsey Johnson to Marc Jacobs to Chanel can be found online for a discount as long as you look hard enough and know where to look.

Some websites features sales that last only a few hours or on a first come, first serve basis for ultra luxury goods like handbags that are perfect for a special night out. When it comes to these kinds of sales, it’s best to go ahead and buy, if you can afford it. It also helps to have Clear so that I don’t miss out with slow Internet. These sales get bought out so quickly, especially with people looking for any kind of discount with the recent recession.

Others just have accessories from last season or ones that have maybe just a loose thread here or there that keep them from being sold for full price.

Just because you can’t afford designer clothing at full price doesn’t mean you can’t buy any at all!
