Want a career (or business) that brings a smile to your heart? Don't know exactly what that career might be? This list of ideas can start you on your way. Make the process fun by scheduling a visit to your
favorite place -- the beach, mountains, whatever -- where you can compile your lists and daydream too!

Seven years ago, I completed the process described below by trial and error -- or was it error and error?! I didn't have a non-biased person, such as my coach or a consultant to support and assist me in the process. I created the process as I went along. You are much
luckier than I was at the time! You have this Life Resume and you know where you can go to hire a coach!

Take an assessment test: personality, skills, etc. I have compiled a few lists of free online assessment tests and quizzes for you at Also check your local phone book for
college career centers, career consultants, or career counselors who
offer such tests and many other helpful services too. 

Start a new type of resume. List the first paying job you had and then start writing all the tasks you performed. You will not be
graded on your penmanship... promise!

Compose a volunteer resume, same format as listed above - listing thepositions and tasks you performed.

Create a list of what you volunteered to do when you went to school.What organizations did you belong to? What projects did you volunteer for? If you're a mom and/or wife (dad or husband), add lists for
those areas too! You're putting together a "this is your liferesume".

Create a list of every career you've ever thought you might enjoysince you were 5 years old. (Ages 6-10 are extremely important!)

Now go back to all your lists and cross off every task that drove you crazy, or that you couldn't stand doing, or that you promised yourself you'd never do again! Ask yourself, "is this something that I would enjoy doing for 8 hours"?

Take a look at what you are left with and look for the patterns. Forexample: Did you enjoy teaching in each paying and volunteer   held? Does organizing or working with numbers or working with
your hands come up in your descriptions time and time again? Does a clear picture of your ideal career or business shine through?
