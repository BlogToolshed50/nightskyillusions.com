Up-selling is one of the most successful marketing trends today. Everywhere you go, someone is trying to get you to buy more. From some leading company with its super-size options to clothing stores that try to sell you shoes to match your outfit, everyone&#8217;s jumping on the band wagon. Why? It works!

Your customers already know that you have great products and provide satisfactory service. They trust you to come through for them. Think about it&#8230; it&#8217;s much easier to make sales to someone you already have a relationship with.

Use every opportunity to increase your sales volume within the customer audience you already have. Do you have a product that goes with the one they are purchasing? Offer it to them at the register. It&#8217;s a proven and effective method for increasing sales. You may be shocked at the additional sales you can generate from those who are already buying from you. 

If you want to stand out from the crowd, create a unique selling proposition that stresses the benefits the customers will receive from doing business with you. Will they get faster service? Go ahead and dramatize it, but keep the customer at the focus&#8230;&#8221;Get free overnight delivery!&#8221; Hey, it tells the customer&#8230;you get quick service and a discount on shipping. Two definite benefits in one statement.

Why should someone buy from you and not your competitor? I hate to deal a blow to your ego, but it really has nothing to do with you , your product, or your service. Yeah, its a little self-centered, but customers are attracted by offers that point out the things that benefit them.

Don&#8217;t go out on a limb to create new products and services to get attention. Just, add a special benefit to the ones you already have&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s quicker service. The most effective things to emphasize are benefits that your competition cannot or is not willing to give.
