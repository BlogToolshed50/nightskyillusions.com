1. Recognize that LIFE is what you get when you're born... 

...LIVING is what you do with it! 
You can sit back and wait for life to happen to you or you can make it happen yourself. As Maya Angelou once said, 'Life likes to be taken by the lapel and told, I'm with you kid. Let's go!' 

2. Define life... It leads to the fine life. 

Life is not a slogan, no matter what Nike, McDonald's, ABC, NBC, or any other media giant might have you believe. While those 'Life is...' t-shirts are often witty, the philosophy they propose, like the shirts themselves, are rarely 'one size fits all.' 

Define life and living on your own terms and you've a better chance of getting both. 

3. Take charge of your life. 

Geoffrey Abert said that when you take charge of your life '...there is no longer need to ask permission of other people or society at large. When you ask permission, you give someone veto power over your life.' 

To start living your life you've got to be in control of it. 

4. Little things mean a lot. 

Life throws a lot of little negative things in our way that must be dealt with or else they will greatly diminish how we enjoy our days. 

Stephen Vincent Benet said it best: 'Life is not lost by dying; life is lost minute by minute, day by dragging day, in all the thousand small uncaring ways.' 

5. Employ the power of positive quitting. 

Most of us view quitting as something negative, but it's not. 'Winners never quit,' we're told, when, in reality, winners quit all the time: choosing to stop doing things that aren't creating the results they desire. 

When you quit all the things that aren't working for you... When you quit tolerating all the negative things that hold you back... You'll create a positive 'charge' in your life as well as well creating the space in your life for more positive experiences. 

6. Charge into your future!

As you recreate this positive force in your life, take big, massive leaps into your future. Be imaginative, bold, and brave! The results may surprise you. 

7. Use everything. 

You are blessed with a particular set of skills and talents that NO ONE else has. Use every skill and talent to live your life as joyfully and abundantly as possible. Leave this life as Erma Bombeck wished to: 'When I stand before God at the end of my life, I would hope that I would not have a single bit of talent left and could sayComputer Technology Articles, 'I used everything you gave me.''
