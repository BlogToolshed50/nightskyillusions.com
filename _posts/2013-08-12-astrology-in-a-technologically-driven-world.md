To Believe or Not To Believe? (Predicting the Past)

It all boils down to this one question. Fortune-telling, tarot card reading, astrology, horoscopes, numerology. They all ask us to invest in them something from inside ourselves: total faith and belief, because the slightest doubt will cancel everything out.

And in this world of ours where almost everything has a monetary equivalent, belief is a free luxury. It is easy to believe. It&#8217;s not always to see is to believe. Sometimes, somethings must be believed to be seen. It&#8217;s easy to believe; you just open your mind.

The hard part is standing by our beliefs and making them our own, and breathing life on them, till we are one and the same.

To believe doesn&#8217;t mean resignation to fate. It doesn&#8217;t mean just because we are Scorpios, or Arians, or Saggitarians, we must comply with whatever characteristics our star signs are supposed to carry. To believe is to explore what else is beyond. Stretch our limits, be more than just what has been allotted to us.

Humans are creatures who like to revel in their chosen beliefs. It&#8217;s what separates us from animals: choice. We choose our beliefs, We hide our doubts. We obsess about the future.

Why do we want to know the future?

Humans are a curious species not contented with living in the present. We are time-travelers, gripped by our past, fascinated by the future. We want to make things right and prevent those that would go wrong.

It is all about control. To glimpse the future is power. Then, we wouldn&#8217;t have to be helpless victims of bad weather, bloody wars, accidents and other mishaps. We may not successfully be able to radically alter the future, but at least we can manage it in our favor.

We need to be assuaged and appeased that our lives are purposeful, and have meaning. And the present moment is not enough to supply us all we need&#8211;after all, it is such a fleeting moment, readily gone, classified and shelved right away as the past the next day.

The past and the future is what we rely on, what we try to link, to be able to come to terms with ourselves.
  
Psychics or Skeptics? (Remembering the Future)
  
Life is deliberately full of mysteries, not for us to rack our brain trying to solve every little equation, but for us to just sit back and relax and enjoy the little surprises that await us.

Even if that surprise is on the other side of the computer screen, blinking hard, hopeful. Indeed, technology is the unfailing medium in spreading oneness in all of us.

Instead of being hard-headed skeptics, let&#8217;s open our minds and hearts to the possibilities of the future.
