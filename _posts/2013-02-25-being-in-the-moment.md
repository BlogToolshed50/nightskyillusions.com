Man has got into the habit of always wishing and attempting to live in the future, but we can only live in the moment. Yesterday has gone past and tomorrow is guaranteed to none of us; but today is here before us, so lets make the best of it. We can never live tomorrow, or yesterday but only today. Hence, it is important to celebrate each day which is a special gift from God to us, and make it special and unique. We should live each day as if it was the last day in our life and strive to accomplish all our heart’s desires.

In the words of that beautiful hymn: “One day at a time Sweet Jesus”, we should ask God for the grace to live one day at a time – take each day as it comes and not worry about tomorrow or future problems. Each day in the morning we should sing the hymn: “This is the day the Lord has made, let us rejoice and be glad in it”.

The future has uncertainties so it is pointless to worry or to even be fanatically obsessed about what our plans for tomorrow are. For when you really come to think of it, no body knows what tomorrow holds. Absolutely nobody. This is not suggesting that you should give up on life, but rather enjoy the moment of NOW, because that is what is available to us. Yes, you may have plans for tomorrow or memories of the past but don’t forget that you are living NOW. If you miss the moment of NOW, then you will live in regret, regretting the missed moments you could have enjoyed that went past you.

Each moment of our lives is unique and special and we should cherish it. Appreciate the present because when it is gone, it is gone. You can never go back, for you will always be in the NOW. The wise man always lives in the present and plans meticulously how to spend the 24 hours at his disposal, giving the most urgent things topmost priority.

Regrets and worries simply keep us mentally busy, blocking the flow of new ideas. Quieten the mind, be still, be here, be free like the birds of the air, and allow the creativity of God to flow in your life. For it is when the mind is quite that our Higher Self can freely operate.
