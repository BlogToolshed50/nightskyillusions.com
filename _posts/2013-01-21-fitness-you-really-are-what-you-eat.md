Fitness is so much more important than most people imagine. Fitness isn&#8217;t just about looking good, but about feeling your best and being able to dig in and enjoy life. Diet fitness is probably the most important element to success and being able to reach your personal goals.

The food you eat accounts for up to 80% of your fitness efforts. This truly puts a different spin on the way we should be looking at food and how it applies to our fitness goals. If you&#8217;ve ever heard the phrase &#8220;Garbage In, Garbage Out&#8221;, it should be particularly important when it comes to our bodies on a daily basis. It&#8217;s impossible to feel your best when you fill your body with food that amounts to nutritional garbage.

So what does diet fitness mean and how can it be achieved?

Very simply put, diet fitness is giving your body the required nutrition from the food you eat to increase and maintain health and physical fitness. Does that sound too simplistic? It actually isn&#8217;t is hard as some people believe. It&#8217;s all about the choices we make every time we sit down to eat.

The quickest way to make a giant leap forward in your diet fitness goals is to give up processed foods. Most people perceive giving up their chippy dippy boxed snacks and sweets as a terrible sacrifice rather than taking a positive stand and improving their health. Remember that the majority of food manufacturers aren&#8217;t interested in your health, they are only interested in separating you from your money.

Become a food snob! Exercise your right to a healthy and beautiful body by refusing to purchase or eat inferior overly processed food. Demand fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains and lean meats at every meal. Aim for as much as 85% of each day&#8217;s diet to come from raw, whole, unprocessed food as close to it&#8217;s natural state as possible.

By embracing whole and unprocessed foods as the major portion of your daily food intake, you will go a long way in achieving diet fitness and a healthy body.
