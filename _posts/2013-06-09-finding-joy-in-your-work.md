Unfortunately I see a growing trend in our nation to move away from that awareness. Instead of relishing a purpose and the joy of pursuit, people have become conditioned to do less and less while demanding more and more. They&#8217;ve been trained to look to others, even the government, to take care of them. They have become passive and dependent, lackluster, idle, and despairing. What a sad state!

In America 65% of those who do work are merely tolerating their job or career. They are marking time and hanging on, wishing for retirement. They view work as a negative, have caged themselves in, lost touch with the desires of their inner self and settled for a life of mediocrity.

The Correct View of Work

I was very blessed to have a German father who taught me the habit of work and the sense of pride in a job well done. I quickly learned that work was a challenge, not a chore; that work polishes the silver and gold of our character; lifts our spirits; expands our creativity and teaches us to overcome adversity. In short, work is a very good thing.

The first car I ever owned, Dad purchased for $12.00. He took the old car apart and laid all the pieces on a large canvas. He then told me, &#8220;If you can put it back together, you can have it.&#8221; I did exactly that and I drove away in it! Or as Leonardo Di Vinci so aptly said, &#8220;Oh Lord, Thou give us everything at the price of effort.&#8221;

The Mission of Work

When you are doing the right type of work for you, when your goals are clear and exciting, work is not a burden but a blessing. It is work that has accomplished all the great achievements of mankind. No painting was ever painted, no music was ever composed, no building ever rose to the sky, and no space ship ever soared into space without work.
  
Your work should not be something you tolerate, but should contain a cause or a mission that speaks to your true nature and your greatest aspirations. When you have enthusiasm, a healthy self-image, and a positive mental attitude about your work, it multiplies all future advancements, opening doors to opportunities and promotion.

Identifying the Right Work

Your work will be happy, satisfying, and successful if it fulfills the following requirements:
  
· Your work allows you to use your full potential for creative expression.
  
· Your work fills your time with activity that is intensely interesting to you.
  
· Your work gives you the opportunity to share yourself with other people.
  
· Your work brings you the financial reward you desire.

Benefits of Work

The benefits of work are also incredibly numerous:
  
· Work structures time, the basic building blocks of life.
  
· Work increases your energy and capacity to perform.
  
· Work offers opportunity for growth.
  
· Work eliminates boredom, vice, and need.

Many parents today make it their goal to not have their children work as hard as they did, therefore inadvertently teaching their children that work is something to be avoided. They have forgotten that it was their hard work that made them a success!

Changing Your Work Attitude and Performance

One of the most powerful tools for changing your mental programming is the use of affirmations. Affirmations are statements that are said in the present tense as if something is already true. Interestingly enough our minds do not know the difference between fantasy and reality and therefore whenever we say is received as fact. And since things have to be mentally accomplished before they can be materially accomplished, affirmations are very effective.

I have used a number of affirmations over the years with great success. I will list a few of my own and you can add some of your own creation. Remember: If you can say it and repeat it, you can become it.

· &#8220;I enjoy my work. It is an important part of my life.&#8221;
  
· &#8220;I like what I do and the rewards I earn from my work.&#8221;
  
· &#8220;I work quickly and efficiently.&#8221;
  
· &#8220;I set goals for daily activity and meet them regularly.&#8221;

Idleness totally exhausts, robbing you of hope and opportunity. Work, on the other hand, brings joy, satisfaction, accomplishment, and financial reward. Remember, &#8220;Whatever you vividly imagine, ardently desire, sincerely believe, and enthusiastically act upon must inevitably come to pass!&#8221;
