Guest post of the week by Brittany Booker

Coming from a large family, I always love watching my families. Because of this reason, I am so excited about the premier of the show Better with You. Between all of the press interviews, clips posted online and reviews of the show, I think this show may be a big hit for ABC. The show centers on the love lives of three couples that are all at different stages in their relationships. From the very new relationship to a couple that has been married for thirty-five years, Better With You will show how differently each couple views love and relationships. These couples are all within one family, which will make the dynamics of each relationship even that much more interesting.

Between the humor of the everyday things that happen in relationships and the real problems that couples face, this show is going to tackle many people&#8217;s problems head on. The cast includes JoAnna Garcia and Jennifer Finnigan, both actresses that I love. I&#8217;m excited to watch a show that is going to focus on showing relatable stories in a humorous way. ABC has had some great success with comedies in the past few years, so I am hoping that this is going to keep their streak alive.
