We rely on all kinds of tools and advice to help our businesses grow, from accounting and legal advice to graphic design and sales seminars. But what are we doing for the important job of building our business&#8217;s reputation in the community?

Public relations skills and techniques are a powerful part of any growing business, but many small organizations believe that the cost of getting into the PR game will cost them thousands NOT hundreds of dollars. If you take the traditional approach to public relations, you may be right PR Agencies are known for high hourly rates and retainer payment plans.

But the INTERNET has changed all that, empowering business owners with a host of tools they can deploy to enhance all parts of their business including building a strong public relations program.

Like many business owners, you may feel that your regular monthly ad in the newspaper is enough publicity for the month and all you have to do is sit back and wait for the customers to show up at the door. NOT so! Running any kind of business &#8211; no matter how small &#8211; without a dynamic PR program is leaving something that can rapidly grow your business in the lap of the gods.

Take the first step &#8211; talk to someone who knows something about PR &#8211; many companies such as www.prmadeeasy.com offer a free introductory consultation to help you get started. AND then, believe it or not, you can start doing your own PR.

Would your business benefit from a strong PR campaign?

* Would media coverage help promote your product or service?
      
* Do you need sales and marketing assistance?
      
* Are you trying to build your company&#8217;s image in the community? 

If the answer is yes to any of these questions, with a few hours of your time and the aid of some well-crafted online tools and resources, you could be profiting from a well-honed PR campaign.

PR is more than just sending e-mails and writing press releases, Public Relations can also help explore and exploit strategies such as:

* Creating or expanding an Internet presence
      
* Rolling out a new product or service
      
* Reaching out to the local community and building a presence for your business
      
* Promoting community involvement through your business and employees
      
* Marketing a new store location 

If you&#8217;re still debating whether PR can help you, consider one final point: You need to proactively manage your business from day one and if your company&#8217;s reputation matters it means you need a public relations program and strategy to ensure your business is profitable and protected.
