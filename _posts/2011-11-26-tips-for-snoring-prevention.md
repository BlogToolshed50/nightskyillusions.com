Knowing what causes snoring can greatly help you both to find relief if you are already suffering from its effects or to find ways of preventing yourself from becoming a poor victim.

Though not regularly the cause of aggravated problems (except for social embarrassment and potential risks of discontented relationship), it is still best if you are not a sufferer yourself.

Many fall victim in this noisy nighttime dilemma. While some are not aware that they have the condition, many are known to seek ways to get around the troubles that it causes.

Like most other conditions, snoring can be prevented. If you are close to becoming a snorer yourself or if you know one who shows initial signs of developing this condition, you can find good use in the advises that we have in this article. Please read on.

Snoring occurs when the collapsible part of the throat meets. Coupled with the passage of air into the throat, these dangling parts are likely to produce vibrations that create the noisy sounds. Why this condition occurs at night is not a mystery.

While it is true that we breathe 24 hours a day, we only snore when our body is totally relaxed. Thus, it is often advised that snorers maintain a tensed sleeping position until the body gets used to this state. 

If you do not like the idea, however, you can prevent snoring through practicing a sideward sleeping position to widen the passage through which air may run through. This passage is congested when we sleep on our backs since our heads are forced to fall back. Additionally, our lower jaw is encouraged to open, therefore creating a space wherein the tongue can droop back. When this occurs, the normal air passage will be obstructed by these components.

We all know that when a passage narrows, the pressure that regularly runs through it will increase. This principle occurs in the throat which explains why there are people who snore and there are those who don&#8217;t, and why snores come in different intensity and sounds.

Obesity is known to induce snoring. This is due to the fact that heavier people are more likely to have extra (and often unnecessary tissues). The neck of an overweight person is known to have more muscles and adipose tissues that hamper the normal delivery of breathing.

Thus, to prevent the possibility of producing nighttime respiratory vibration, one is advised to refrain from gaining too much weight. Not only would you escape from major health threats such as general unhealthiness of the body or coronary diseases, you can also save yourself from distracting your bed partner&#8217;s sleep and your own.

Some people practice mouth breathing. Add to the fact that this is generally not a healthy practice, mouth breathing can also raise one&#8217;s susceptibility towards snoring. It may seem awkward to switch back to nasal breathing initially though, but in time you would learn to breathe naturally using your nose while sleeping. In the end, you would be thankful that you took time and learned patience in eliminating this habit.

If you would notice, most advises in preventing snoring concern lifestyle-changing practices. This is because snoring, as a whole, don&#8217;t necessarily have to root from biological causes while we may find sufferers who are actually bothered by nasal deformities or extra large adenoids and tonsils.
