When I asked my daughter what she wanted to dress up as for Halloween, so told me that she wanted to be a princess. I thought that was easy enough to find a costume for, but then she told me that she wasn&#8217;t sure which princess she wanted to be and wanted me to help her choose one.

So I took to my 4g internet and tried to figure out whichever Disney princess costume would be easiest to make. But then I realized that none of them were going to be really easy to make.

She kept asking me the princess question and wouldnt&#8217; let up. Then I remembered that she already had a pink dress that she dresses up in sometimes for fun that i could change around and make it look like Aurora&#8217;s from Sleeping Beauty, so I think that we&#8217;re just going to do that. Besides, I can just get a crown and then some pink fabric to sew on as the pink details on the dress.
