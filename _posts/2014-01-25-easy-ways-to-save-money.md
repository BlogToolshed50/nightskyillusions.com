A penny saved is a penny earned so they say. Today most people want to save all the pennies they can, in fact if you look after the pennies the &#8220;pounds&#8221; will look after themselves.

Now I&#8217;m not saying you should be a cheapskate but if you go around wasting money you won&#8217;t be able to say you are &#8220;Penny-wise&#8221;

Now a good example of how to save money is this. You might be down at the mall or Ice Skating and you find yourself getting hungry.

You could immediately go to a local fried chicken or hamburger franchise. There you will find a myriad of ways to &#8220;Waste your money&#8221;&#8230; Yes that&#8217;s right!!

Now when a detective arrives on a crime scene one of the first questions he should ask himself is this &#8220;Who stands to gain financially from this crime?&#8221;

See what I mean? You spend your good money so someone can poison you with overdoses of sugar, chemicals, trans-fats etc etc.

A better idea is this. Cut some fresh fruit into small easy to bite pieces, put it into a plastic bag and take it with you when you go out. You might be in a barbershop or haberdashery for example when hunger pangs strike. No problem, two pieces of melon are quickly taken from the pocket, delicious.

Don&#8217;t worry if you feel this is contrary to today&#8217;s &#8220;norm&#8221;. It is. But if you want to start a trend&#8230; THIS IS the way to do it. Maybe yo can discover another way to eat a banana or something and get the method named after you. I&#8217;m not kidding. Ask the EARL of SANDWICH if you think I&#8217;m kidding.

Good Luck
