Thanks to Mary York for the guest blog post.

One of the easiest websites for my son to operate is PBS. This website has so much to offer that it has quickly became one of my son’s favorite pastimes. While I do not allow him to spend more than an hour on the hughes net internet a day, this website is where he chooses to spend that entire hour.

His favorite feature of the PBS website is the video section. With so many different video and short cartoons to watch on the website, he is kept constantly entertained. His favorite part of the video section is anything involving Clifford the big red dog. I trust him spending time on this website since I am so familiar with all that PBS has to offer. Many of these programs have been around since I was a child and are still just as educational and entertaining now, as they were then.

I usually set him up to watch videos on PBS’s website in the evening, while I am preparing dinner. It is one of the easiest ways to keep my eye on him and keep him entertained. Logging on using our satellite internet is quick and easy, allowing me more time to spend preparing dinner without having to worry about interruptions. With so many different videos to watch, he is kept entertained.
