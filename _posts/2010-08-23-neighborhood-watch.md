Thanks to mommy blogger Bethany Bacon for the post.

One of the best ways my neighbors and I protect our homes is through a neighborhood watch program. A neighborhood watch program gives us the security and peace of mind that say, a home security alarm would give us. In this article, I will explain why it is important to have a neighborhood watch program for people that travel a lot and like to go on vacation.

Whenever I leave for vacation, I simply ask one or two of my neighbors to keep an eye on my home. It does not mean that my neighbors have to keep an eye on the home 24/7 and watch it like a hawk. Instead, my neighbors just pay attention to any uninvited guests that may be hanging out in front of the home. My neighbors also pick up my mail, so that it is not stolen by intruders in the neighborhood. So far, this system has worked well in my neighborhood. If one of us watches a home, then it is unsaid that the owner of that home will watch ours the next time we go on vacation. I believe this system has prevented many burglaries in our neighborhood, since thieves know the homes are being closely watched. We are also very protective of one another and will not hesitate to call the police if something looks wrong.

I highly recommend your neighborhood participate in a watch program, so that travelers can feel more at ease when they leave their homes. Click Here for more great safety tips.
