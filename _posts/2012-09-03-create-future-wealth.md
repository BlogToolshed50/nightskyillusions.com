Whether your business is a start-up or has been around for many years, there are things we all need to do to ensure its success. I have for years seen and heard of things that have helped businesses grow and prosper. These 7 ideas, when acted upon, are all things that successful business owners have done, which have helped them say to themselves – “I am a success”. Read on, to see if maybe one or all of these ideas could help you. Have self belief, if you believe in yourself, so will others.

Just try it, follow these 7 steps, and see what they can do. For those of you who end up tipping the scales at the millionaire side of things, do drop me a line, I would love to hear the success stories.

1. Do something positive right now! &#8211; Stop reading, get a piece of paper and write down a small task that will contribute to one of your goals. Do it right away. It might be; backing up your data on your computer, writing a letter to an important customer or make a call to a partner relating to business. What ever it is you do, ensure that the positive outcome will be beneficial to your business. Do it now, this means no postponing and no delaying.

2. Set your personal and business goals for the next year! – This could be a revenue figure, a number of customers you want on your books or the number of leads you need to generate. Alternatively, you may wish to focus on profit goals and time off goals. The reason for goal setting is that it helps you stay focused, while having something to aim for. If you are feeling good about this, why not follow on with your 3, 5 and 10 year goals!

3. Decide on how you will reach you goals – develop a plan! – Some companies offer Strategic planning from a business and personal perspective. If you have the discipline, do it yourself. Take your goals, and look for ways you want to achieve them. Be a bit like a football coach. Create play moves that will help you and your team score.

4. How to put your plan to effective use! – Action part of your plan every day that will bring you closer to your goals. It doesn&#8217;t have to be big &#8211; but if you have too many days between actions, your momentum will dwindle and eventually die. Sometimes, as a result of either your actions or an outside influence, you will need to alter your plan, such as the competitions defense being strong.

5. Actions speak louder than words! &#8211; Be decisive, nothing slows momentum more than indecision. Decide as quickly as possible and then take some immediate action to support the decision &#8211; no matter how trivial it seems.

6. Identify your strengths, compliment your weaknesses by hiring or outsourcing &#8211; When questioned on the secret of his greatness, Abraham Lincoln replied “It is not that I am great, rather I surround myself with great people”. Build a strong team of people with complimentary help you get things done more quickly and efficiently. If it does not make sense to hire full-time people to do things like accounting or sales & Marketing – outsource it. This way you only pay for the value of the service you get.

7. Have self belief, if you believe in yourself, so will others! – The converse is also true. How can a sales person discuss value of ownership with a customer if they don’t believe in it? If you are frustrated or discouraged, it will certainly be tough to build momentum. But if you are optimistic, things will happen more freely and your momentum will build.

These 7 steps, may not be the answer to all people, but by following these, you will have the chance to empower yourself, and thereby your business. This will give you the chance to start, resurrect or grow your business, to ensure you get the flow of profit that will leave you prosperous and happy.
