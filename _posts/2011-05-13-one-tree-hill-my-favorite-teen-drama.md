I was originally drawn to One Tree Hill&#8217;s soapy storylines and small town atmosphere when it first premiered in 2003. Since then, it quickly became my favorite teen drama after I got satellite tv from www.cannonsatellite.com. I heard that it was recently renewed for its eighth season, and although I don&#8217;t think the show is as good as it was in seasons 1-4, I still enjoy it. I always watch the show on my satellite dish and record it on my DVR.

Throughout the course of the series, the principle characters grow from high school friends and lovers to young men and women in their twenties. They&#8217;ve gotten married, had children, and started careers. Though the show is often too drama-filled for my taste, I do occasionally find similarities between the lives of those I know and the lives of the characters on the screen.

My favorite character has always been Haley. She&#8217;s funny and her character is often the most sensible and consistent. I&#8217;ve hated Lucas and Peyton for about five seasons. Peyton is whiny and Lucas is selfish, so I wasn&#8217;t too upset when they got married, started a family, and moved away from Tree Hill two seasons ago. They were the two lead characters and people said the show would lose a large part of its fan base. Maybe they did lose fans, but they haven&#8217;t lost me.
